                <p>Angular Forms
                 - Angular Forms are classified into 2 types
                         a) Template Driven Forms
                         b) Model Driven Forms or Reactive Forms
                 
                 <p>Template Driven Form
                    - Forms are configured and handled at View level. [ in UI ]
                    - It uses MVVM [Model-View  View-Model].
                    - The library required for template driven form is defined in "FormsModule" of "@angular/forms".
                    - The element is defined by using "ngForm".
                    - The other input and form elements are defined by using "ngModel".
                            frmRegister.value            object { key : value }
                                                            Element Name is Key
                                                            Element Value is its value</p>
                 - It reduces the number of requests.
                 - It improves the load time.
                 - Separation, Reusability and Extensibility issues.
                 - UI is heavy and slow in rendering.
                 
                 <p>Note: Always use tempalte forms when you want a form with stable functionality and doesn't require regular extentions.
                 
                    Ex:
                     template-form.component.ts
                    
                     import { Component } from '@angular/core';
                    
                    @Component({
                      selector: 'app-template-form',</p>
                   templateUrl: './template-form.component.html',
                   styleUrls: ['./template-form.component.css']

                     }

             <p>Angular Forms
                 - Angular Forms are classified into 2 types
                         a) Template Driven Forms
                         b) Model Driven Forms or Reactive Forms
                 
                 Template Driven Form
                 - Forms are configured and handled at View level. [ in UI ]
                 - It uses MVVM [Model-View  View-Model].
                 - The library required for template driven form is defined in "FormsModule" of "@angular/forms".
                 - The element is defined by using "ngForm".
                 - The other input and form elements are defined by using "ngModel".
                         frmRegister.value            object { key : value }
                                                         Element Name is Key
                                                         Element Value is its value
                 - It reduces the number of requests.
                 - It improves the load time.
                 - Separation, Reusability and Extensibility issues.
                 - UI is heavy and slow in rendering.
                 
                 Note: Always use tempalte forms when you want a form with stable functionality and doesn't require regular extentions.
                 
                 Ex:
                  template-form.component.ts
                 
                  import { Component } from '@angular/core';

                     }
                 }
                  
                
                         frmRegister.value                             { }
                         frmRegister.value.UserName            only user name " "
                        
                 - You can directly access any specific element value
                 
                          UserName.value
                          Age.value
                 
                                     Validating Template Driven Form
                 - Validation is the process of verifying user input.
                 - Validation is required to ensure that contradicationary and unauthorized data is not get stored into database.
                 - Validations can be handled
                         a) Client Side
                         b) Server Side
                 - Client Side validations in JavaScript and jQuery are handled by using lot of functions. [string functions, math functions, array function etc..]
                 - Angular is provided with "Validation Services".
                 - These validation service can use HTML validations and verify values without writing much logic.
                 - HTML validations are
                         required
                         minlength
                         maxlength
