                We can create an application or software in fallowing flavors:
                1) Desktop: The applications which are installable in local systems are called
                desktop applications.
                2) Mobile: The applications which are installable in mobile phones or tablets
                downloaded from play store for android and apple store for ios.

                accessible from any location using browser.

                Web applications are network enable applications. We can deploy any web
                applications in servers and we can access them over network using server ip
