                We can create an application or software in fallowing flavors:
                1) Desktop: The applications which are installable in local systems are called
                desktop applications.
                2) Mobile: The applications which are installable in mobile phones or tablets
                downloaded from play store for android and apple store for ios.
                3) Web: The applications which are deployable in any server and can be
                accessible from any location using browser.
                
                WHAT IS WEB APPLICATION?
                Web applications are network enable applications. We can deploy any web
                applications in servers and we can access them over network using server ip
                address and application name.

                Business layeris a server-side program which is nothing but automation of
                business rules. Client layer will interact with business layer to persist data.
                Data layeris database software where we can store client related data. Business
                layer will interact with data layer.
                
                How the Web Works
                1. When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet ServiceProvider (ISP).
                You type adomain name or web addressinto your browser to visit a site;for
                example: google.com, oracle.com, microsoft.com.
                2. Your computer contacts anetwork of servers calledDomain Name System
                (DNS)servers. These act like phonebooks; they tell your computerthe IP
                address associated withthe requested domain name.An IP address is a
                numberof up to 12 digits separatedby periods / full stops. Everydevice
                connected to the webhas a unique IP address; it islike the phone number for
                thatcomputer.
                3. The unique number that theDNS server returns to yourcomputer allows your -
                browserto contact the web serverthat hosts the website yourequested. A web
                server is acomputer that is constantlyconnected to the web, and is setup
                specially to send web pagesto users.
                4. The web server then sends thepage you requested back to yourweb browser.
                What is web browser?
                It is client-side lightweight software installed in client machine. It sends http
                request from client to server;ittakeshttp response from server.
                Browser provides navigation among web pages, and browsers executes html, css,
                JavaScript files and displays output to user.
