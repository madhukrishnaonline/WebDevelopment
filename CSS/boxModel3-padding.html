            How the Web Works
            1. When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet ServiceProvider (ISP).
            You type adomain name or web addressinto your browser to visit a site;for
            example: google.com, oracle.com, microsoft.com.
            2. Your computer contacts anetwork of servers calledDomain Name System
            (DNS)servers. These act like phonebooks; they tell your computerthe IP
            address associated withthe requested domain name.An IP address is a
            numberof up to 12 digits separatedby periods / full stops. Everydevice
            connected to the webhas a unique IP address; it islike the phone number for
            thatcomputer.
            3. The unique number that theDNS server returns to yourcomputer allows your -
            browserto contact the web serverthat hosts the website yourequested. A web
            server is acomputer that is constantlyconnected to the web, and is setup
            specially to send web pagesto users.
            4. The web server then sends thepage you requested back to yourweb browser.
            What is web browser?
            It is client-side lightweight software installed in client machine. It sends http
            request from client to server;ittakeshttp response from server.
            Browser provides navigation among web pages, and browsers executes html, css,
            JavaScript files and displays output to user.
